# Twin_Rotor_MIMO
The Twin Rotor System demonstrates the principles of a non-linear MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple  Output) system, with significant cross-coupling. Its behaviour resembles a helicopter, but the  angle of attack of the rotors is fixed and the aerodynamic forces are controlled by varying the  speeds of the motors.
